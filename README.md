ATM Machine Simulation (Task_1)

 
This Python program simulates the basic functionalities of an ATM machine as a part of my Internship Project at Octanet Services. It allows users to check their balance, withdraw cash, deposit funds, and change their PIN. The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and provides a simple command-line interface for interaction.

Features: 

Check Balance: View the current balance of the account.

Withdraw: Withdraw a specified amount from the account balance.

Deposit: Deposit a specified amount into the account.

Change PIN: Update the PIN associated with the account.

Transaction History: Track and display transaction history (not implemented in the basic version).

How to Use:

Insert your card (simulated delay for 5 seconds).

Enter your PIN (default PIN is 1234).

Choose from the available options to perform transactions or exit.

Details:

Language: Python

Libraries Used: time (for simulating delay)

Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs gracefully using try-except blocks.

Security: Basic PIN verification ensures only authorized users can access the ATM functionalities.
